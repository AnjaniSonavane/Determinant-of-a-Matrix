# Determinant-of-a-Matrix

The determinant of a matrix is a special number that can be calculated from a square matrix.

Assuming all matrices are square matrices, there is a number associated with each square matrix [A] called the determinant, D, of [A]. If [A] is order 1, then [A] has one element:

• For a square matrix of order 3, the minor of an element aij is the determinant of the matrix of order 2 by deleting row i and column j of [A].

-For a 2×2 matrix (2 rows and 2 columns):

The determinant is:

|A| = ad − bc
"The determinant of A equals a times d minus b times c"

-For a 3×3 matrix (3 rows and 3 columns):

The determinant is:

|A| = a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)
